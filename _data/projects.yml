    I worked for a Web Developer, Marketing Director and Blogger. I built their website developed by GatsbyJS and 
    made their partners' official blogs. ([Equalum](https://www.equalum.io/), [Wandisco](https://www.wandisco.com/)) Also I managed their Google/Naver ads.
    Mostly, I learned how the corporation works.
